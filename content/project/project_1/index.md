### Abstract
In this project, I first conducted a comprehensive analysis to identify all the test scenarios that needed to be covered. Then, I proceeded to create a <u style="color: #7dafe2;">flowchart</u> outlining the automation testing process. This flowchart included the <u style="color: #7dafe2;">validation items, test data, definition of positive and negative test cases</u>, as well as the expected error codes and messages that the web server should respond with in different scenarios.

After finalizing the flowchart, I proceeded to develop the <u style="color: #7dafe2;">automated testing package</u>. This package was designed to take the response from the web server as input and generate a detailed test report as output. The testing package included various test cases covering both positive and negative scenarios to ensure thorough testing of the web server's functionality.

Overall, this approach enabled us to streamline the testing process and significantly reduce the time required for testing while ensuring comprehensive coverage of all relevant test scenarios.
