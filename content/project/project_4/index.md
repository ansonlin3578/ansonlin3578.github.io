  In a Kaggle competition, I leveraged data mining and text-mining techniques to filter the dataset, identifying key features in tweets that indicate sentiment. This process involved removing redundant words to avoid model bias and ensure accurate sentiment analysis. Furthermore, I fine-tuned a BERT pre-trained model to achieve a ranking of `30th out of 99 competitors` in the competition.
