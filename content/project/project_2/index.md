1.Docker Deployment:
Set up Docker containers for the development environment, including web server and database.
Use docker-compose for orchestration and networking.

2.API Functional Testing:
Write pytest test cases to cover API functionality.
Utilize pytest fixtures for environment setup and teardown.

3.Performance Testing:
Use JMeter and k6 to simulate user scenarios and test web server performance under load.
Monitor metrics like response time, throughput, and error rate.

4.Resource Monitoring:
Monitor Docker container resource consumption (CPU, memory, network) using built-in tools or third-party solutions.
Store monitoring data in a database for analysis.

5.Data Integrity:
Verify correctness of data written to the database by the application.
Write test cases and use assertions to ensure data integrity.
