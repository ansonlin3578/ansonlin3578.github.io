  In a Kaggle competition, I utilized data engineering techniques to create new feature columns, improving the predictive performance of the model. Additionally, I addressed label imbalance in supervised learning by employing oversampling and undersampling techniques. The final model ensemble consisted of a simple neural network and a ResNet model, enhancing predictive accuracy.

  Finally, achieved the remarkable feat of securing the `first position` in prediction accuracy among 13 participating teams.
